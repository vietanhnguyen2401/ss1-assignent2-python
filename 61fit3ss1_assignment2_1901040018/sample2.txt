A Story of Kim Van Kieu translated by Huynh Minh Quan


Long time in human life
Fate is so bad for nice people
Go through such difficult
I saw and had struggle feelings
One is full others are lacking
Heaven it keeps hating beauty
On light read history
Popular love story for teens
Years of Jiajing The Ming
Country is in peace nothing special
Vuong was a rich uncle
Normal man with normal mansion
Quan is his youngest son
Study to pass entrance paper
Among his two sisters
Kieu is a bit older than Van
Both girls are excellent
Despite the difference in charm
Thuy Van looks pretty calm
Full moon face with ma'am body
With jade like melody
Snow white skin with curly cloud hair
Kieu even looks unfair
Thuy Van cannot compare to Kieu
